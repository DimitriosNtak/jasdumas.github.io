```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# to be rendered as html for papers.md section

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path='{{ site.url }}/post_data/quirky-r-')
```

## Partial Matching
```{r, pm}
df = data.frame("a"= letters[1:10], "abc" = 1:10)

head(df)

df$ab # returns the column named "abc"
```

## Ploting

How did the plot function know about the x and y variables to be ploted and labeled?
```{r, quirkyplot}
plot(pressure)
```
