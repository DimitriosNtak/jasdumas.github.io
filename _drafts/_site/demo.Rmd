## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r ggcars, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) +
     geom_point(color="dodgerblue") +
     theme_minimal() +
     labs(title = "Cars Dataset")
print(g)
```

## Directions for writing Rmd to Md files for Jekyll blogs

1. Launch RStudio, Start project in _drafts folder of your jekyll page repo
2. File > New File > R Markdown file
3. Edit yaml header to mimic jekyll with title and layout parameters and save file
    a. make sure to include the figure path in the knitr chuck options: *knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path='/post_data/exploring-the-cars-dataset-')* with your desired folder outputs
4. First time only: create *r2jekyll.R* file which creates the .md file and does some house keeping about figures
5. Go to Terminal and change directory to the drafts folder `cd /Users/jasminedumas/Desktop/GitHub\ Clone\ Repos/jasdumas.github.io/_drafts/`
6. Change permission of *r2jekyll.R* file with: `chmod +x r2jekyll.R`
7. Execute `./r2jekyll.R demo.Rmd` changing the .Rmd file name
