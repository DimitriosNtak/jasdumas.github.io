About
---------
I'm seeking to utilize my computational programming & data analysis skills in a position that focuses in developing innovative open source software tools. I value hard work, creativity and openness. I'm an active member of the R Programming community and have contributed by formerly co-hosting a podcast on the language, [RTalk](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/r-talk/id1030819337?mt=2) and as an organization member & curator of the online newsletter, [RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/).

**Featured Projects**: I have experience using my data science toolkit in several projects which include:   

* [Tutorial on Web scraping craft brewery ratings from Beer Advocate with R and import.io](http://trendct.org/2016/03/18/tutorial-web-scraping-and-mapping-breweries-with-import-io-and-r/)
* [Shiny app for gene expression analysis for bioinformaticians](http://gdancik.github.io/shinyGEO/)
* [Dashboard app of Reported Crimes in Hartford Connecticut](https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/hartford-crime/)

R Packages
----------
* **[`ttbbeer`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ttbbeer)**: R data package of beer statistics from U.S. Department of the Treasury (TTB)
