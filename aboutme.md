:information_source: I like long hikes, big data, and cold craft beer. I currently live in [Central Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury,_Connecticut) with my partner and our Scottish Terrier mix dog,
[Fiona](https://twitter.com/jasdumas/status/679480102443417600).

:briefcase: Currently working as a **Data Scientist** ([The Hartford](https://www.thehartford.com/), :soon: [Simple](https://www.simple.com/)) . Previously worked in **R&D Engineering** roles ([Medtronic](http://www.medtronic.com/covidien), QDx) and as an **Aerospace Manufacturing Engineer** ([AdChem](http://acmt.aero/)).

:mortar_board: Currently a M.S. graduate student in **Predictive Analytics** at [DePaul University](http://www.cdm.depaul.edu/academics/Pages/Current/Requirements-MS-In-Predictive-Analytics-Computational.aspx) focusing in **Data Science & Computational Methods**. Previously earned a Professional Certificate in **Medical Product Development** at [University of California, Irvine Extension](http://ce.uci.edu/areas/life_sciences/medical_products/). Previously earned a Bachelor of **Biomedical Engineering** from the [University of Hartford](http://www.hartford.edu/ceta/undergraduate/engineering/BM/). My senior research project was to develop a prototype [walk-assist](http://www.tuvie.com/wp-content/uploads/ekso-bionic-suit1.jpg) device for a T4 Paraplegic client; project nicknamed "Iron man".

:floppy_disk: I enjoy developing open source software tools to help assist others complete their data analysis work! I like programming in R & Python and interested in learning about cloud computing!

:earth_americas: I grew up in the *Lower Hudson Valley, NY* and stayed around *Connecticut* after undergrad. I'm *sometimes* available for *remote consulting* opportunities working on [**diverse** teams](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bonniemarcus/2015/08/12/the-lack-of-diversity-in-tech-is-a-cultural-issue/#7170290c3577) to solve interesting challenges with data.
