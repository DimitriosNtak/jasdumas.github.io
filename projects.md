## R Packages

* [ttbbeer](https://github.com/jasdumas/ttbbeer): This is my **first** R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). This package provides the data for materials used at U.S. breweries as listed in the Beer Monthly Statistical Releases. The motivation behind this package was to provide an analysis-ready data set as the original data is in PDF format. :beers: [Now available on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ttbbeer)

* [shinyLP](https://github.com/jasdumas/shinyLP): This is my **second** R package on CRAN and it provides templates and functions for landing home pages for your shiny application - leading to a better UX for your users and writing less HTML for the developer. :globe_with_meridians: [Now available on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shinyLP)

* [dumas](https://github.com/jasdumas/dumas): My vanity R package filled with useful functions for data analysis and R development. :squirrel:

## Web Applications / Dashboards

* [shinyGEO](http://jasdumas.github.io/shinyGEO/): The Gene Expression Omnibus Analysis with Shiny (Project Name: GEO-AWS) is a web application to download gene expression datasets from the GEO Repository and perform differential expression and survival analyses. This project was partially developed as part of the [2015 Google Summer of Code program](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/jasdumas/5668600916475904) - [Manuscript Publication](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/08/07/bioinformatics.btw519.full.pdf?keytype=ref&ijkey=R1zz4cjrdze0PAC) :microscope:

* [*Flexdashboard* of Reported Crimes in Hartford, Connecticut](https://jasminedumas.shinyapps.io/hartford-crime/): Exploratory Data Analysis and data visualizations (including a interactive `leaflet` map) surrounding public safety questions on data from 2005 to Current from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov) - [blog post](http://jasdumas.github.io/2016-08-22-crime-incidents-hartford/) :police_car:

* [*Flexdashboard* of Connecticut Real Estate Sales](http://jasdumas.github.io/tech-short-papers/flex-realestate.html): Exploratory Data Analysis of Connecticut real estate sales from 2011 to 2013 from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov)  - [Additional RPubs modeling work](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/ct-realestate) :house_with_garden:

## Media

* [R for FinTech](https://jasdumas.github.io/r4fintech/): A in-progress guidebook written in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) for R programming with Financial Technology (FinTech) applications. :dollar:

* [RTalk Podcast](https://twitter.com/RTalkPodcast): I co-hosted a technical podcast on the statistical software and programming language R with some buddies in the community. [Old Episodes on available iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/r-talk/id1030819337?mt=2) :speaker:

## Tutorials

* [Web scraping and mapping breweries with import.io and R](http://trendct.org/2016/03/18/tutorial-web-scraping-and-mapping-breweries-with-import-io-and-r/): Getting information on Breweries can be a difficult process with data from multiple sources or sources that have limited access to developers. Import.io instantly turns webpages into data with minimal or no set-up involved. I developed this tutorial to extract meta data on Connecticut-based breweries. :beer:

* [Web Scraping the Best of Rotten Tomatoes](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/rotten-tomatoes): Using the `rvest` package, I web scraped several "best of" film genres lists into a a table and provided a `plotly` data visualization to understand ratings versus reviews. :tomato:

## Other Projects

* [Insurance Claim Complaints](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/eda-ct-insurance): Exploratory Data Analysis of Connecticut insurance company complaints, resolutions, status, and recoveries from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov) :umbrella:

* [Virtual Bioinformatics Notebook](https://github.com/jasdumas/DouglasFir): I spent a few great months gaining informatics skills at the [University of Connecticut](http://bioinformatics.uconn.edu/) (UCONN) working on the genomics of big trees and walnuts. :deciduous_tree:

* [My solved Project Euler problems](https://github.com/jasdumas/LeonhardEuler): For fun I like to stretch my mathematical and python knowledge and attempt to solve these famous problems. :snake:

* [Star Wars 2048 Game](http://jasdumas.github.io/2048/): This project involved conceptualizing a re-design for the popular web application game 2048. In my version, I gave it a much needed Star Wars upgrade where the objective is to achieve the highest square of Yoda! :milky_way:

* [Exploring Towed car data in Hartford, CT during a snow storm](http://rpubs.com/jasdumas/hartford-snow-tows): Exploratory Data Analysis of a dataset from [https://data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov) which tracked cars that were towed during and after a snow storm in Winter 2015. :parking:
